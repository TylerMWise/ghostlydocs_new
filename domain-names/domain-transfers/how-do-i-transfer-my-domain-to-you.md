# How do I transfer my domain to you?

The transfer process for domain names varies, dependent on the type of domain in question.

**UK domains (all domains that end .uk)**

Domains ending in .uk require 2 simple steps to be completed to transfer them in instantly:

**1)** Update the **Tag** to **STACK.**

**2)** Complete the transfer via the Ghostly Cloud **control panel**.

To do these steps:&#x20;

2. Login to your account at [**app.ghostly.cloud** ](https://app.ghostly.cloud)and click **Transfer a Domain**.
3. Enter the domain name and click **Search**.
4. Add the domain to your basket and complete checkout.&#x20;
