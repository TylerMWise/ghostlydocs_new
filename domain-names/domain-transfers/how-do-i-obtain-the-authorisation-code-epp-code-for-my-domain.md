# How do I obtain the authorisation code/EPP code for my domain?

If you intend to transfer your GTLD domain elsewhere, you'll need its authorisation/EPP code. The following guide details how to obtain this from your Ghostly Cloud control panel.

â€‹Please note, domain names that have been registered or transferred within the last sixty days may not be transferred to or from Ghostly Cloud. This is a registry restriction.

* Log in to [app.ghostly.cloud](https://app.ghostly.cloud)**.**
* Once logged in, head to **Manage Domains**
* Select **Manage** on the required domain name.
* Under **Domain Management**, select **Transfer Away**.
* If the domain name is locked, you should then be presented with the following: 'To unlock the domain, you will need to select the green arrow.' Doing so will unlock the domain. If the domain is unlocked, proceed to the next step.
* Your authorisation code will then be presented to you.
