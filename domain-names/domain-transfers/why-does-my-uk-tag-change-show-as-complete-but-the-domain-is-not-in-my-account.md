# Why does my UK tag change show as complete but the domain is not in my account?

A UK domain transfer is a 2 stage process. You need to:

* Change the tag to **STACK**
* Transfer this in through the Ghostly Cloud control panel

The best way to check the current tag for a domain name is via the [Nominet WHOIS](https://www.nominet.uk/whois/) system. Once you've confirmed this is using STACK, complete the transfer following the steps below:

* Login to your account and click **Transfer a Domain**
* Enter the domain name and click **Search**.
* Add the domain to your basket and complete checkout.

The transfer will complete almost instantly.
