# What is your IPS Tag?

To transfer domain names ending with **.uk** you'll first need to contact your current provider and request they change the Tag to **STACK**. Once the Tag change has been completed you'll be able to complete the transfer over to us.

If you're having any problems with changing your Tag we recommend contacting [Nominet](http://www.nominet.uk/). Nominet are the '.uk' registry and oversee all UK domain names.
