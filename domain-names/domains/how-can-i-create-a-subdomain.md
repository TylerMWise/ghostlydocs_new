# How can I create a subdomain?

To create a subdomain:

* Log in to [app.ghostly.cloud](https://app.ghostly.cloud/)
* Head to **Manage Hosting** -> **Manage.**
* Select the **Subdomains** icon**.**

You can then add your subdomain into the Subdomain field and select **Create Subdomain**. You're also able to change the Document Root so that you can direct the subdomain to the folder of your choosing.

**What is the document root?**

The document root is the folder which the subdirectory will use, for example, you may have a directory within your web space located within **public\_html** called **support** (i.e. public\_html/support), you could point your subdomain to this location by adding **public\_html/support** in the Document Root field.&#x20;

Note: Updating a document root can take \~15 minutes, so you may just need to be patient whilst that updates.
