# Where can I view the nameservers of a domain?

If you manage your domain name with Ghostly Cloud and have access to it via [app.ghostly.cloud](https://app.ghostly.cloud) you can view the nameservers the domain is using by following the steps below.&#x20;

* Log in to [app.ghostly.cloud](https://app.ghostly.cloud)
* Select **Manage Domains** and locate the domain youâ€™d like to check, select **Manage.**
* Select the **Nameservers** icon to view what nameservers the domain is pointing to.

You can edit and update them here.

Please note that nameserver changes usually take between 6-8 hours - but can take up to 24 hours.&#x20;
