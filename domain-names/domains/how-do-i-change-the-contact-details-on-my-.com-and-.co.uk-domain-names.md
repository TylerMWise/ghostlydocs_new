# How do I change the contact details on my .com and .co.uk domain names?

Changing the contact details for a domain that you have registered with Ghostly Cloud is usually done in either of two ways. This depends on what type of domain name you have.

**For a .com domain:**

1. Go to **Manage Domains**, locate the domain name you would like to change the contact details for and select **Manage**
2. Select **Contact Details** and you will be able to update the contact information for the domain name.

**For .uk domains (including co.uk):**

1. You’ll need to login to Nominet. Head to [https://secure.nominet.org.uk/auth/login.html](https://secure.nominet.org.uk/auth/login.html) and login or create an account by selecting **First time logging in or forgotten your password?**. Enter the email address you used to register the domain. You’ll then get an email prompting you to set up a password.
2. Use the password you create to log in. You’ll be shown a list of your .uk domain names. Choose which one you want to change the contact information for and **Edit**.
