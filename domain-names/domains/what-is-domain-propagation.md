# What is domain propagation?

DNS propagation defines the process of updating information across the internet. There are two forms of DNS propagation: the first is the changes made to the DNS zone and the second is the changes made to WHOIS information.

An change made to your DNS zone will only usually affect a few servers and is the fastest change. Making a change that affects your WHOIS information can take up to 72 hours to propagate.

After the order of a domain or transfer of a domain, there will be a period where you canâ€™t see your domain. This is due to millions of servers having to update with the new information. Your website may not be visible for up to 48 hours.
