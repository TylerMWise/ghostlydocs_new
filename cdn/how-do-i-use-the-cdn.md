# How do I use the CDN

The CDN is quick and easy to use.

Head to the package you want to enable our CDN for and locate the **CDN** section.&#x20;

To activate the main **Edge Caching** element of the CDN, select **Edge Caching** - select the toggle to activate it (**Manage Hosting -> Manage -> Edge Caching).**

Thereâ€™s nothing more you need to do! All static content on your website will now be cached automatically and served from the CDN node closest to its location.

#### Purge Cache

To purge the cache that's stored at the CDN node head to the **Edge Caching** section and select the **Purge Everything** button.&#x20;
