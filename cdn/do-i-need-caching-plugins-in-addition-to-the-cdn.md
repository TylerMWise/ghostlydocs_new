# Do I need caching plugins in addition to the CDN?

The short answer is no, the Content Delivery Network takes care of caching for you. The CDN caches static content and stores it until it's purged via the **Edge Caching** section in [app.ghostly.cloud](https://app.ghostly.cloud).

This means you shouldn’t use any additional caching plugins such as W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache.

In addition, we handle optimisation via the Website Acceleration Suite**.** The module improves website load times by automatically implementing web performance best practices to a website. This includes optimising images, JavaScript minification and combining CSS – all to improve website load times.

Therefore, you don’t need plugins such as WP Smush, Lazy Loading, EWWW Image Optimizer or Autoptimise.
