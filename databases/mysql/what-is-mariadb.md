# What is MariaDB?

MariaDB is a fork of MySQL.

The database structure and indexes of MariaDB are the same as MySQL. This makes MariaDB a backward compatible, drop-in replacement for MySQL.

We currently run MariaDB version `10.2.29`

To check the version of MariaDB:

1. Head to **Manage Hosting**, then **phpMyAdmin**.
2. Select the database in the left-hand panel. &#x20;
3. Select the **Query** tab at the top.
4. Type the query: SELECT VERSION(); and select **Go.**
5. The version of MariaDB will then be outputted.
