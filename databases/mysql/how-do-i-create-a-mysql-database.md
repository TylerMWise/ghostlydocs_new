# How do I create a MySQL database?

You can create MySQL databases in seconds directly from your Ghostly Cloud control panel.&#x20;

This option is unavailable for packages hosted on our WordPress platform due to its WP-optimised nature. If you need to create a MySQL database, you'll need to move the website to our Linux platform.To create new MySQL databases:

1\. Log in to [app.ghostly.cloud ](https://app.ghostly.cloud)and select **Manage Hosting**.\
2\. Choose **Manage** next to the hosting package you wish to create a MySQL database for. \
3\. Under **Web Tools**, select **MySQL Databases**. Here you can complete the following actions:

* Create new MySQL databases. Each MySQL database has a maximum size of 1024MB (1GB).
* Manage existing databases.
* Add additional MySQL users to databases.
* Manage your additional MySQL users.

4\. Under **Add a new MySQL Database**, choose a name for your database. Database names must be between 6 and 20 characters long, and we automatically add a suffix to avoid name collisions with other users.

5\. Once you have chosen a name, click **Create Database**. Your new MySQL database will automatically appear in the **Manage MySQL Databases** section underneath.

From here you can change the automatically generated password, monitor usage, remove your MySQL database, or log in to your database.
