# What's the maximum MySQL database size allowed?

At Ghostly Cloud, each MySQL database you create can store up to 1024 MB (1 GB) of data. As databases comprise of only text, this is a lot of space in real terms; to put it into perspective, a Ghostly Cloud customerâ€™s average database size is just 10 MB.

In the rare event that you need more than 1024 MB, you'll need to add an additional database. You aren't able to add more MySQL databases to websites hosted on our WordPress hosting platform; you would need a Linux package for this.&#x20;
