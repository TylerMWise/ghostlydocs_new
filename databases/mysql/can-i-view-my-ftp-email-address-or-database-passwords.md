# Can I view my FTP, email address, or database passwords?

We encrypt all FTP, email and database passwords so they are not visible as plain text inside your control panel.

The exception is the very first FTP account: this password is visible on the right hand side when you manage your hosting. You're able to change all passwords and changes are usually processed immediately.

**Please note:** the majority of database passwords will be saved in the configuration or connection strings for your website. For example, for WordPress, the database password is visible inside the wp-config.php file.
